# Unit 9 Challenge - README Creation

  ## Description
  Work on this project was implemented at the request of the client, whose user story stated the following: “AS A developer, I WANT a README generator SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.” The following is a table of contents to direct the user to various parts of the README:

  ## Table of Contents

  - [Usage](#usage)
  - [Contributing](#contributing)
  - [License](#license)
  - [Testing](#testing)
  - [Questions](#questions)

  ## Installation
  The project was created using VS Code editor, where is was then uploaded to a Github repository. The project was not deployed to a website. Instead, Screencastify was used to create an instructional video as to how the script is run in terminal. Output of running the script can be visualized in the terminal after having installed inquirer.js and node.js.

  ## Usage
  Open terminal. Ensure that npm is initialized using "npm init". This will install all of the necessary components/libraries needed for this particular project based on the files present in VS Code explorer. The next step is to run the program by the following command: node index.js. Once run, the user will be prompted with the intended set of questions. Answering them will generate a README file.
